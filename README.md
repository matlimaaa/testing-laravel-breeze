## About this base project

Here you will find a base project for a slightly more robust application, with Laravel 10 as its core. This project provides a solid structure for building scalable and high-performance web applications.

Using containers, we have created a ready-to-use architecture with multiple implementation possibilities. The container for the Laravel 10 application enables the development of advanced features and seamless integration with popular libraries and packages.

- Additionally, we provide a container for the Nginx server, ensuring efficient and reliable performance for hosting your application in production.
- For cache management, we offer a container with Redis, a powerful in-memory storage solution that accelerates data access and improves application performance.
- The container for queue management allows for background task execution, enabling asynchronous processing and optimizing resource utilization.
- Lastly, we have included a container for the database, providing a ready-made infrastructure for storing and manipulating application data.

With this base project, you have the flexibility to adapt and expand functionality according to your project's specific needs, ensuring a more robust and scalable application.
